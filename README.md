**Calculator with Voice Assistant**

Ever wished you could just say your calculations instead of typing them out?  
This little project is a simple calculator that works with both *buttons* and *your voice*.  
Built using plain *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it shows how the **Web Speech API* can be used to make everyday tools a bit smarter.  

What it can do
 -Perform basic math (add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo).  
- Take calculations through *voice commands* — just click the mic and talk.  
- Clean and minimal interface, easy to use on desktop.  
- Runs right in your browser — no installations needed.  

 **How it’s built**

- *HTML* for the layout.  
- *CSS* for styling (with a little animation for the mic).  
- *JavaScript* for all the logic.  
- *Web Speech API* for the voice recognition part.
